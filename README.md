1. Project Title and HeadlineTic-Tac-Toe Console Game: Array Management and Win Condition Logic (Java)2. Short DescriptionThis project implements a classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Java console. The core is built around a 3x3 array to represent the board, and simple methods to handle player moves, display the board, and check for a winner based on straight-line completion.3. Tech StackLanguage: Java (Core)Libraries: java.util.Scanner (Crucial for taking user input)Data Structure: A char array (char[][] board = new char[3][3];) for the game state.4. Game Flow (Usage)The game follows a simple turn-based loop handled by the main method:Initialization: The $3 \times 3$ board array is created and filled with empty spaces (e.g., a space character ' ').Display Board: The current state of the board is printed to the console.Player Turn: The current player ('X' or 'O') is prompted to enter their desired move (typically by entering row and column indices, e.g., '1 2').Input Validation: The game checks if the chosen spot is within bounds and is currently empty.Update Board: If the move is valid, the array is updated with the player's marker.Check Status: The game calls a method to check for a win or a draw.Loop/Exit: If the game is not over, the turn switches, and the loop repeats (Step 2). If a winner or draw is detected, the final result is printed, and the program exits.Walk-Through Key Visuals (Code Concepts)The game relies on three primary methods/classes:1. The GameEngine ClassThis contains the main method and controls the overall game loop and player turns.Usage: Manages the Scanner object for input and alternates the current player variable (e.g., char currentPlayer = 'X';).2. The Board Management MethodA method (e.g., printBoard(char[][] board)) responsible for displaying the current state of the game to the console.Concept: Iterates through the $3 \times 3$ array and prints the characters, using separators (like | and -) to visually format the grid.3. The WinChecker Method (The Core Logic)The most critical part, responsible for determining if the last move resulted in a win.Concept: This method (e.g., checkWin(char[][] board, char marker)) checks 8 specific conditions for the given player's marker:3 Rows: Checks if board[i][0] == board[i][1] == board[i][2] for $i = 0, 1, 2$.3 Columns: Checks if board[0][j] == board[1][j] == board[2][j] for $j = 0, 1, 2$.2 Diagonals: Checks the top-left to bottom-right diagonal (board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]) and the top-right to bottom-left diagonal (board[0][2], board[1][1], board[2][0]).
